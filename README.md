# ðŸ§  Customer Churn Prediction & Retention System

A machine learning project to predict telecom customer churn and explain the key factors influencing that risk â€” presented via an interactive, Streamlit-powered dashboard.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Objective

- Predict customer churn probability with high recall
- Understand what drives churn at an individual level
- Build an explainable, lightweight web app using Streamlit
- Package it as a professional, portfolio-grade ML project

---

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle â€“ Telco Customer Churn](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)
- Records: 7,043 customers
- Target: `Churn` (Yes/No)
- Features: Demographics, subscription plans, billing & support info

## ðŸ§ª Model Pipeline Overview

* **EDA**: Exploratory visualizations and pattern mining
* **Preprocessing**: OneHotEncoding + StandardScaling using ColumnTransformer
* **Modeling**: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest
* **Tuning**: GridSearchCV + class balancing (SMOTE, weights)
* **Explainability**: SHAP for local + global feature impact

## ðŸ“ˆ Sample Output

Hereâ€™s a sample prediction with SHAP-based explanation:

![Churn Prediction Output](https://github.com/kuldeepnethues/customerchurn/blob/main/sample_churn_prediction.png)

> In this case, the customer is predicted to churn with 72.92% probability â€” largely influenced by short tenure, monthly contract, and lack of online security.

## âœ… Future Enhancement

* Integrate GenAI to suggest personalized retention actions based on prediction and SHAP drivers
